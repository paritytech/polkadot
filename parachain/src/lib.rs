#![warn(unused_crate_dependencies)]

//! Defines primitive types for creating or validating a parachain.
//!
//! When compiled with standard library support, this crate exports a `wasm`
//! module that can be used to validate parachain WASM.
//!
//! ## Parachain WASM
//!
//! Polkadot parachain WASM is in the form of a module which imports a memory
//! instance and exports a function `validate_block`.
//!
//! `validate` accepts as input two `i32` values, representing a pointer/length pair
//! respectively, that encodes [`ValidationParams`].
//!
//! `validate` returns an `u64` which is a pointer to an `u8` array and its length.
//! The data in the array is expected to be a SCALE encoded [`ValidationResult`].
//!
//! ASCII-diagram demonstrating the return data format:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! [pointer][length]
//!   32bit   32bit
//!         ^~~ returned pointer & length
//! ```
//!
//! The wasm-api (enabled only when `std` feature is not enabled and `wasm-api` feature is enabled)
//! provides utilities for setting up a parachain WASM module in Rust.
