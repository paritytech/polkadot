# Check execution time.
# There are two different timeout conditions: BACKING_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT(2s) and
# APPROVAL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT(6s). Currently these are not differentiated by metrics
# because the metrics are defined in `polkadot-node-core-pvf` which is a level below
# the relevant subsystems.
# That being said, we will take the simplifying assumption of testing only the
# 2s timeout.
# We do this check by ensuring all executions fall into bucket le="2" or lower.
# First, check if we have at least 1 sample, but we should have many more.
