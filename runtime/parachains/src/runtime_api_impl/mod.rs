//! Runtime API implementations for Parachains.
//!
//! These are exposed as different modules using different sets of primitives.
//! At the moment there is a `v2` module for the current stable API and
//! `vstaging` module for all staging methods.
//! When new version of the stable API is released it will be based on `v2` and
//! will contain methods from `vstaging`.
//! The promotion consists of the following steps:
//! 1. Bump the version of the stable module (e.g. `v2` becomes `v3`)
//! 2. Move methods from `vstaging` to `v3`. The new stable version should include
//!    all methods from `vstaging` tagged with the new version number (e.g. all
//!    `v3` methods).
