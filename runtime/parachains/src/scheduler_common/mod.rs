//! The scheduler module for parachains and parathreads.
//!
//! This module is responsible for two main tasks:
//!   - Partitioning validators into groups and assigning groups to parachains and parathreads
//!   - Scheduling parachains and parathreads
//!
//! It aims to achieve these tasks with these goals in mind:
//! - It should be possible to know at least a block ahead-of-time, ideally more,
//!   which validators are going to be assigned to which parachains.
//! - Parachains that have a candidate pending availability in this fork of the chain
//!   should not be assigned.
//! - Validator assignments should not be gameable. Malicious cartels should not be able to
//!   manipulate the scheduler to assign themselves as desired.
//! - High or close to optimal throughput of parachains and parathreads. Work among validator groups should be balanced.
//!
//! The Scheduler manages resource allocation using the concept of "Availability Cores".
//! There will be one availability core for each parachain, and a fixed number of cores
//! used for multiplexing parathreads. Validators will be partitioned into groups, with the same
//! number of groups as availability cores. Validator groups will be assigned to different availability cores
//! over time.
