//! # Parachain `Crowdloaning` pallet
//!
//! The point of this pallet is to allow parachain projects to offer the ability to help fund a
//! deposit for the parachain. When the crowdloan has ended, the funds are returned.
//!
//! Each fund has a child-trie which stores all contributors account IDs together with the amount
//! they contributed; the root of this can then be used by the parachain to allow contributors to
//! prove that they made some particular contribution to the project (e.g. to be rewarded through
//! some token or badge). The trie is retained for later (efficient) redistribution back to the
//! contributors.
//!
//! Contributions must be of at least `MinContribution` (to account for the resources taken in
//! tracking contributions), and may never tally greater than the fund's `cap`, set and fixed at the
//! time of creation. The `create` call may be used to create a new fund. In order to do this, then
//! a deposit must be paid of the amount `SubmissionDeposit`. Substantial resources are taken on
//! the main trie in tracking a fund and this accounts for that.
//!
//! Funds may be set up during an auction period; their closing time is fixed at creation (as a
//! block number) and if the fund is not successful by the closing time, then it can be dissolved.
//! Funds may span multiple auctions, and even auctions that sell differing periods. However, for a
//! fund to be active in bidding for an auction, it *must* have had *at least one bid* since the end
//! of the last auction. Until a fund takes a further bid following the end of an auction, then it
//! will be inactive.
//!
//! Contributors will get a refund of their contributions from completed funds before the crowdloan
//! can be dissolved.
//!
//! Funds may accept contributions at any point before their success or end. When a parachain
//! slot auction enters its ending period, then parachains will each place a bid; the bid will be
//! raised once per block if the parachain had additional funds contributed since the last bid.
//!
//! Successful funds remain tracked (in the `Funds` storage item and the associated child trie) as long as
//! the parachain remains active. Users can withdraw their funds once the slot is completed and funds are
//! returned to the crowdloan account.
