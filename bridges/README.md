# Parity Bridges Common

This is a collection of components for building bridges.

These components include Substrate pallets for syncing headers, passing arbitrary messages, as well
as libraries for building relayers to provide cross-chain communication capabilities.

Three bridge nodes are also available. The nodes can be used to run test networks which bridge other
Substrate chains.

ðŸš§ The bridges are currently under construction - a hardhat is recommended beyond this point ðŸš§

## Installation

To get up and running you need both stable and nightly Rust. Rust nightly is used to build the Web
Assembly (WASM) runtime for the node. You can configure the WASM support as so:

```bash
rustup install nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

Once this is configured you can build and test the repo as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bridges-common.git
cd parity-bridges-common
cargo build --all
cargo test --all
```

Also you can build the repo with
[Parity CI Docker image](https://github.com/paritytech/scripts/tree/master/dockerfiles/bridges-ci):

```bash
docker pull paritytech/bridges-ci:production
mkdir ~/cache
chown 1000:1000 ~/cache #processes in the container runs as "nonroot" user with UID 1000
docker run --rm -it -w /shellhere/parity-bridges-common \
                    -v /home/$(whoami)/cache/:/cache/    \
                    -v "$(pwd)":/shellhere/parity-bridges-common \
                    -e CARGO_HOME=/cache/cargo/ \
                    -e SCCACHE_DIR=/cache/sccache/ \
                    -e CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/cache/target/  paritytech/bridges-ci:production cargo build --all
#artifacts can be found in ~/cache/target
```

If you want to reproduce other steps of CI process you can use the following
[guide](https://github.com/paritytech/scripts#reproduce-ci-locally).

If you need more information about setting up your development environment Substrate's
[Getting Started](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/) page is a good
resource.

## High-Level Architecture

This repo has support for bridging foreign chains together using a combination of Substrate pallets
and external processes called relayers. A bridge chain is one that is able to follow the consensus
of a foreign chain independently. For example, consider the case below where we want to bridge two
Substrate based chains.

```
+---------------+                 +---------------+
|               |                 |               |
|     Rialto    |                 |    Millau     |
|               |                 |               |
+-------+-------+                 +-------+-------+
        ^                                 ^
        |       +---------------+         |
        |       |               |         |
        +-----> | Bridge Relay  | <-------+
                |               |
                +---------------+
```

The Millau chain must be able to accept Rialto headers and verify their integrity. It does this by
using a runtime module designed to track GRANDPA finality. Since two blockchains can't interact
directly they need an external service, called a relayer, to communicate. The relayer will subscribe
to new Rialto headers via RPC and submit them to the Millau chain for verification.

Take a look at [Bridge High Level Documentation](./docs/high-level-overview.md) for more in-depth
description of the bridge interaction.

## Project Layout

Here's an overview of how the project is laid out. The main bits are the `node`, which is the actual
"blockchain", the `modules` which are used to build the blockchain's logic (a.k.a the runtime) and
the `relays` which are used to pass messages between chains.

```

```

## Running the Bridge

To run the Bridge you need to be able to connect the bridge relay node to the RPC interface of nodes
on each side of the bridge (source and target chain).

There are 2 ways to run the bridge, described below:

- building & running from source
- running a Docker Compose setup (recommended).

### Using the Source

First you'll need to build the bridge nodes and relay. This can be done as follows:

```bash
# In `parity-bridges-common` folder
cargo build -p rialto-bridge-node
cargo build -p millau-bridge-node
cargo build -p substrate-relay
```

### Running a Dev network

We will launch a dev network to demonstrate how to relay a message between two Substrate based
chains (named Rialto and Millau).

To do this we will need two nodes, two relayers which will relay headers, and two relayers which
will relay messages.

#### Running from local scripts

To run a simple dev network you can use the scripts located in the
[`deployments/local-scripts` folder](./deployments/local-scripts).

First, we must run the two Substrate nodes.

```bash
# In `parity-bridges-common` folder
./deployments/local-scripts/run-rialto-node.sh
./deployments/local-scripts/run-millau-node.sh
```

After the nodes are up we can run the header relayers.

```bash
./deployments/local-scripts/relay-millau-to-rialto.sh
./deployments/local-scripts/relay-rialto-to-millau.sh
```

At this point you should see the relayer submitting headers from the Millau Substrate chain to the
Rialto Substrate chain.

```
# Header Relayer Logs
[Millau_to_Rialto_Sync] [date] DEBUG bridge Going to submit finality proof of Millau header #147 to Rialto
[...] [date] INFO bridge Synced 147 of 147 headers
[...] [date] DEBUG bridge Going to submit finality proof of Millau header #148 to Rialto
[...] [date] INFO bridge Synced 148 of 149 headers
```

Finally, we can run the message relayers.

```bash
./deployments/local-scripts/relay-messages-millau-to-rialto.sh
./deployments/local-scripts/relay-messages-rialto-to-millau.sh
```

You will also see the message lane relayers listening for new messages.

```
# Message Relayer Logs
[Millau_to_Rialto_MessageLane_00000000] [date] DEBUG bridge Asking Millau::ReceivingConfirmationsDelivery about best message nonces
[...] [date] INFO bridge Synced Some(2) of Some(3) nonces in Millau::MessagesDelivery -> Rialto::MessagesDelivery race
[...] [date] DEBUG bridge Asking Millau::MessagesDelivery about message nonces
[...] [date] DEBUG bridge Received best nonces from Millau::ReceivingConfirmationsDelivery: TargetClientNonces { latest_nonce: 0, nonces_data: () }
[...] [date] DEBUG bridge Asking Millau::ReceivingConfirmationsDelivery about finalized message nonces
[...] [date] DEBUG bridge Received finalized nonces from Millau::ReceivingConfirmationsDelivery: TargetClientNonces { latest_nonce: 0, nonces_data: () }
[...] [date] DEBUG bridge Received nonces from Millau::MessagesDelivery: SourceClientNonces { new_nonces: {}, confirmed_nonce: Some(0) }
[...] [date] DEBUG bridge Asking Millau node about its state
[...] [date] DEBUG bridge Received state from Millau node: ClientState { best_self: HeaderId(1593, 0xacac***), best_finalized_self: HeaderId(1590, 0x0be81d...), best_finalized_peer_at_best_self: HeaderId(0, 0xdcdd89...) }
```

To send a message see the ["How to send a message" section](#how-to-send-a-message).

### Full Network Docker Compose Setup

For a more sophisticated deployment which includes bidirectional header sync, message passing,
monitoring dashboards, etc. see the [Deployments README](./deployments/README.md).

You should note that you can find images for all the bridge components published on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/paritytech).

To run a Rialto node for example, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 30333:30333 -p 9933:9933 -p 9944:9944 \
  -it paritytech/rialto-bridge-node --dev --tmp \
  --rpc-cors=all --unsafe-rpc-external --unsafe-ws-external
```

### How to send a message

In this section we'll show you how to quickly send a bridge message, if you want to
interact with and test the bridge see more details in [send message](./docs/send-message.md)

```bash
# In `parity-bridges-common` folder
./scripts/send-message-from-millau-rialto.sh remark
```

After sending a message you will see the following logs showing a message was successfully sent:

```
INFO bridge Sending message to Rialto. Size: 286. Dispatch weight: 1038000. Fee: 275,002,568
INFO bridge Signed Millau Call: 0x7904...
TRACE bridge Sent transaction to Millau node: 0x5e68...
```

## Community

Main hangout for the community is [Element](https://element.io/) (formerly Riot). Element is a chat
server like, for example, Discord. Most discussions around Polkadot and Substrate happen
in various Element "rooms" (channels). So, joining Element might be a good idea, anyway.

If you are interested in information exchange and development of Polkadot related bridges please
feel free to join the [Polkadot Bridges](https://app.element.io/#/room/#bridges:web3.foundation)
Element channel.

The [Substrate Technical](https://app.element.io/#/room/#substrate-technical:matrix.org) Element
channel is most suited for discussions regarding Substrate itself.
