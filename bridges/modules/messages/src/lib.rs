//! Runtime module that allows sending and receiving messages using lane concept:
//!
//! 1) the message is sent using `send_message()` call;
//! 2) every outbound message is assigned nonce;
//! 3) the messages are stored in the storage;
//! 4) external component (relay) delivers messages to bridged chain;
//! 5) messages are processed in order (ordered by assigned nonce);
//! 6) relay may send proof-of-delivery back to this chain.
//!
//! Once message is sent, its progress can be tracked by looking at module events.
//! The assigned nonce is reported using `MessageAccepted` event. When message is
//! delivered to the the bridged chain, it is reported using `MessagesDelivered` event.
//!
//! **IMPORTANT NOTE**: after generating weights (custom `WeighInfo` implementation) for
//! your runtime (where this module is plugged to), please add test for these weights.
//! The test should call the `ensure_weights_are_correct` function from this module.
//! If this test fails with your weights, then either weights are computed incorrectly,
//! or some benchmarks assumptions are broken for your runtime.
