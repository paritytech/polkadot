Plan for the Internal Audit:
1. High-level overview (describing layers, maybe with pictures)
  - what have we done already.
  [Tomek to present]
  [Hernando to help with diagrams today]

2. Demo? How to play with the network.
  [Hernando]

3. Demo of token transfer on Millau.
  [Hernando]

4. Go through the scenario description and let people ask questions in the meantime.
  Jump to the code on demand.
  [Tomek, Hernando, Slava]

  ...

5. The roadmap
  - outstanding issues.
