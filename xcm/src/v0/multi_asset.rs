/// A single general identifier for an asset.
///
/// Represents both fungible and non-fungible assets. May only be used to represent a single asset class.
///
/// Wildcards may or may not be allowed by the interpreting context.
///
/// Assets classes may be identified in one of two ways: either an abstract identifier or a concrete identifier.
/// Implementations may support only one of these. A single asset may be referenced from multiple asset identifiers,
/// though will tend to have only a single *preferred* identifier.
///
/// ### Abstract identifiers
///
/// Abstract identifiers are absolute identifiers that represent a notional asset which can exist within multiple
/// consensus systems. These tend to be simpler to deal with since their broad meaning is unchanged regardless stay
/// of the consensus system in which it is interpreted.
///
/// However, in the attempt to provide uniformity across consensus systems, they may conflate different instantiations
/// of some notional asset (e.g. the reserve asset and a local reserve-backed derivative of it) under the same name,
/// leading to confusion. It also implies that one notional asset is accounted for locally in only one way. This may
/// not be the case, e.g. where there are multiple bridge instances each providing a bridged "BTC" token yet none
/// being fungible between the others.
///
/// Since they are meant to be absolute and universal, a global registry is needed to ensure that name collisions
/// do not occur.
///
/// An abstract identifier is represented as a simple variable-size byte string. As of writing, no global registry
/// exists and no proposals have been put forth for asset labeling.
///
/// ### Concrete identifiers
///
/// Concrete identifiers are *relative identifiers* that specifically identify a single asset through its location in
/// a consensus system relative to the context interpreting. Use of a `MultiLocation` ensures that similar but non
/// fungible variants of the same underlying asset can be properly distinguished, and obviates the need for any kind
/// of central registry.
///
/// The limitation is that the asset identifier cannot be trivially copied between consensus
/// systems and must instead be "re-anchored" whenever being moved to a new consensus system, using the two systems'
/// relative paths.
///
/// Throughout XCM, messages are authored such that *when interpreted from the receiver's point of view* they will
/// have the desired meaning/effect. This means that relative paths should always by constructed to be read from the
/// point of view of the receiving system, *which may be have a completely different meaning in the authoring system*.
///
/// Concrete identifiers are the preferred way of identifying an asset since they are entirely unambiguous.
///
/// A concrete identifier is represented by a `MultiLocation`. If a system has an unambiguous primary asset (such as
/// Bitcoin with BTC or Ethereum with ETH), then it will conventionally be identified as the chain itself. Alternative
/// and more specific ways of referring to an asset within a system include:
///
/// - `<chain>/PalletInstance(<id>)` for a Frame chain with a single-asset pallet instance (such as an instance of the
///   Balances pallet).
/// - `<chain>/PalletInstance(<id>)/GeneralIndex(<index>)` for a Frame chain with an indexed multi-asset pallet
///   instance (such as an instance of the Assets pallet).
/// - `<chain>/AccountId32` for an ERC-20-style single-asset smart-contract on a Frame-based contracts chain.
/// - `<chain>/AccountKey20` for an ERC-20-style single-asset smart-contract on an Ethereum-like chain.
