/// A derivative barrier, which scans the first `MaxPrefixes` instructions for origin-alterers and

/// the newly computed origin.
///
/// This effectively allows for the possibility of distinguishing an origin which is acting as a
/// router for its derivative locations (or as a bridge for a remote location) and an origin which
/// is actually trying to send a message for itself. In the former case, the message will be
/// prefixed with origin-mutating instructions.
///
/// Any barriers which should be interpreted based on the computed origin rather than the original
/// message origin should be subject to this. This is the case for most barriers since the
/// effective origin is generally more important than the routing origin. Any other barriers, and
/// especially those which should be interpreted only the routing origin should not be subject to
/// this.
///
/// E.g.
/// ```nocompile
/// type MyBarrier = (
/// 	TakeWeightCredit,
/// 	AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom<DirectCustomerLocations>,
/// 	WithComputedOrigin<(
/// 		AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom<DerivativeCustomerLocations>,
/// 		AllowUnpaidExecutionFrom<ParentLocation>,
/// 		AllowSubscriptionsFrom<AllowedSubscribers>,
/// 		AllowKnownQueryResponses<TheResponseHandler>,
/// 	)>,
/// );
/// ```
///
/// In the above example, `AllowUnpaidExecutionFrom` appears once underneath
/// `WithComputedOrigin`. This is in order to distinguish between messages which are notionally
/// from a derivative location of `ParentLocation` but that just happened to be sent via
/// `ParentLocaction` rather than messages that were sent by the parent.
///
/// Similarly `AllowTopLevelPaidExecutionFrom` appears twice: once inside of `WithComputedOrigin`
/// where we provide the list of origins which are derivative origins, and then secondly outside
/// of `WithComputedOrigin` where we provide the list of locations which are direct origins. It's
/// reasonable for these lists to be merged into one and that used both inside and out.
///
/// Finally, we see `AllowSubscriptionsFrom` and `AllowKnownQueryResponses` are both inside of
/// `WithComputedOrigin`. This means that if a message begins with origin-mutating instructions,
/// then it must be the finally computed origin which we accept subscriptions or expect a query
/// response from. For example, even if an origin appeared in the `AllowedSubscribers` list, we
/// would ignore this rule if it began with origin mutators and they changed the origin to something
/// which was not on the list.
