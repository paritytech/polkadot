/// execution stops. Else, `Err(_)` is returned if all elements reject the message.
pub trait ShouldExecute {
	/// Returns `true` if the given `message` may be executed.
	///
	/// - `origin`: The origin (sender) of the message.
	/// - `top_level`: `true` indicates the initial XCM coming from the `origin`, `false` indicates an embedded XCM
	///   executed internally as part of another message or an `Order`.
	/// - `message`: The message itself.
	/// - `shallow_weight`: The weight of the non-negotiable execution of the message. This does not include any
	///   embedded XCMs sat behind mechanisms like `BuyExecution` which would need to answer for their own weight.
	/// - `weight_credit`: The pre-established amount of weight that the system has determined this message may utilise
	///   in its execution. Typically non-zero only because of prior fee payment, but could in principle be due to other
	///   factors.
