# Paras Module

The Paras module is responsible for storing information on parachains and parathreads. Registered
parachains and parathreads cannot change except at session boundaries and after at least a full
session has passed. This is primarily to ensure that the number and meaning of bits required for the
availability bitfields does not change except at session boundaries.

It's also responsible for:

- managing parachain validation code upgrades as well as maintaining availability of old parachain 
code and its pruning.
- vetting PVFs by means of the PVF pre-checking mechanism.

## Storage

### Utility Structs

```rust
// the two key times necessary to track for every code replacement.
pub struct ReplacementTimes {
 /// The relay-chain block number that the code upgrade was expected to be activated.
 /// This is when the code change occurs from the para's perspective - after the
 /// first parablock included with a relay-parent with number >= this value.
 expected_at: BlockNumber,
 /// The relay-chain block number at which the parablock activating the code upgrade was
 /// actually included. This means considered included and available, so this is the time at which
 /// that parablock enters the acceptance period in this fork of the relay-chain.
 activated_at: BlockNumber,
}

/// Metadata used to track previous parachain validation code that we keep in
/// the state.
pub struct ParaPastCodeMeta {
 // Block numbers where the code was expected to be replaced and where the code
 // was actually replaced, respectively. The first is used to do accurate lookups
 // of historic code in historic contexts, whereas the second is used to do
 // pruning on an accurate timeframe. These can be used as indices
 // into the `PastCode` map along with the `ParaId` to fetch the code itself.
 upgrade_times: Vec<ReplacementTimes>,
 // This tracks the highest pruned code-replacement, if any.
 last_pruned: Option<BlockNumber>,
}

struct ParaGenesisArgs {
  /// The initial head-data to use.
  genesis_head: HeadData,
  /// The validation code to start with.
  validation_code: ValidationCode,
  /// True if parachain, false if parathread.
  parachain: bool,
}

/// The possible states of a para, to take into account delayed lifecycle changes.
pub enum ParaLifecycle {
  /// A Para is new and is onboarding.
  Onboarding,
  /// Para is a Parathread.
  Parathread,
  /// Para is a Parachain.
  Parachain,
  /// Para is a Parathread which is upgrading to a Parachain.
  UpgradingParathread,
  /// Para is a Parachain which is downgrading to a Parathread.
  DowngradingParachain,
  /// Parathread is being offboarded.
  OutgoingParathread,
  /// Parachain is being offboarded.
  OutgoingParachain,
}

enum PvfCheckCause {
  /// PVF vote was initiated by the initial onboarding process of the given para.
  Onboarding(ParaId),
  /// PVF vote was initiated by signalling of an upgrade by the given para.
  Upgrade {
    /// The ID of the parachain that initiated or is waiting for the conclusion of pre-checking.
    id: ParaId,
    /// The relay-chain block number that was used as the relay-parent for the parablock that
    /// initiated the upgrade.
    relay_parent_number: BlockNumber,
  },
}

struct PvfCheckActiveVoteState {
  // The two following vectors have their length equal to the number of validators in the active
  // set. They start with all zeroes. A 1 is set at an index when the validator at the that index
  // makes a vote. Once a 1 is set for either of the vectors, that validator cannot vote anymore.
  // Since the active validator set changes each session, the bit vectors are reinitialized as
  // well: zeroed and resized so that each validator gets its own bit.
  votes_accept: BitVec,
  votes_reject: BitVec,

  /// The number of session changes this PVF vote has observed. Therefore, this number is
  /// increased at each session boundary. When created, it is initialized with 0.
  age: SessionIndex,
  /// The block number at which this PVF vote was created.
  created_at: BlockNumber,
  /// A list of causes for this PVF pre-checking. Has at least one.
  causes: Vec<PvfCheckCause>,
}
```

#### Para Lifecycle

Because the state changes of parachains and parathreads are delayed, we track the specific state of 
the para using the `ParaLifecycle` enum.

```

```

Note that if PVF pre-checking is enabled, onboarding of a para may potentially be delayed. This can
happen due to PVF pre-checking voting concluding late.

During the transition period, the para object is still considered in its existing state.

## Session Change

1. Execute all queued actions for paralifecycle changes:
  1. Clean up outgoing paras.
     1. This means removing the entries under `Heads`, `CurrentCode`, `FutureCodeUpgrades`, and
        `FutureCode`. An according entry should be added to `PastCode`, `PastCodeMeta`, and
        `PastCodePruning` using the outgoing `ParaId` and removed `CurrentCode` value. This is
        because any outdated validation code must remain available on-chain for a determined amount
        of blocks, and validation code outdated by de-registering the para is still subject to that
        invariant.
  1. Apply all incoming paras by initializing the `Heads` and `CurrentCode` using the genesis
     parameters.
  1. Amend the `Parachains` list and `ParaLifecycle` to reflect changes in registered parachains.
  1. Amend the `ParaLifecycle` set to reflect changes in registered parathreads.
  1. Upgrade all parathreads that should become parachains, updating the `Parachains` list and
     `ParaLifecycle`.
  1. Downgrade all parachains that should become parathreads, updating the `Parachains` list and
     `ParaLifecycle`.
  1. (Deferred) Return list of outgoing paras to the initializer for use by other modules.
1. Go over all active PVF pre-checking votes:
  1. Increment `age` of the vote.
  1. If `age` reached `cfg.pvf_voting_ttl`, then enact PVF rejection and remove the vote from the active list.
  1. Otherwise, reinitialize the ballots.
    1. Resize the `votes_accept`/`votes_reject` to have the same length as the incoming validator set.
    1. Zero all the votes.
## Initialization

1. Do pruning based on all entries in `PastCodePruning` with `BlockNumber <= now`. Update the
   corresponding `PastCodeMeta` and `PastCode` accordingly.
1. Toggle the upgrade related signals
  1. Collect all `(para_id, expected_at)` from `UpcomingUpgrades` where `expected_at <= now` and prune them. For each para pruned set `UpgradeGoAheadSignal` to `GoAhead`. Reserve weight for the state modification to upgrade each para pruned.
  1. Collect all `(para_id, next_possible_upgrade_at)` from `UpgradeCooldowns` where `next_possible_upgrade_at <= now`. For each para obtained this way reserve weight to remove its `UpgradeRestrictionSignal` on finalization.

## Routines

* `schedule_para_initialize(ParaId, ParaGenesisArgs)`: Schedule a para to be initialized at the next
  session. Noop if para is already registered in the system with some `ParaLifecycle`.
* `schedule_para_cleanup(ParaId)`: Schedule a para to be cleaned up after the next full session.
* `schedule_parathread_upgrade(ParaId)`: Schedule a parathread to be upgraded to a parachain.
* `schedule_parachain_downgrade(ParaId)`: Schedule a parachain to be downgraded to a parathread.
* `schedule_code_upgrade(ParaId, new_code, relay_parent: BlockNumber, HostConfiguration)`: Schedule a future code
  upgrade of the given parachain. In case the PVF pre-checking is disabled, or the new code is already present in the storage, the upgrade will be applied after inclusion of a block of the same parachain
  executed in the context of a relay-chain block with number >= `relay_parent + config.validation_upgrade_delay`. If the upgrade is scheduled `UpgradeRestrictionSignal` is set and it will remain set until `relay_parent + config.validation_upgrade_cooldown`.
In case the PVF pre-checking is enabled, or the new code is not already present in the storage, then the PVF pre-checking run will be scheduled for that validation code. If the pre-checking concludes with rejection, then the upgrade is canceled. Otherwise, after pre-checking is concluded the upgrade will be scheduled and be enacted as described above.
* `note_new_head(ParaId, HeadData, BlockNumber)`: note that a para has progressed to a new head,
  where the new head was executed in the context of a relay-chain block with given number. This will
  apply pending code upgrades based on the block number provided. If an upgrade took place it will clear the `UpgradeGoAheadSignal`.
* `lifecycle(ParaId) -> Option<ParaLifecycle>`: Return the `ParaLifecycle` of a para.
* `is_parachain(ParaId) -> bool`: Returns true if the para ID references any live parachain,
  including those which may be transitioning to a parathread in the future.
* `is_parathread(ParaId) -> bool`: Returns true if the para ID references any live parathread,
  including those which may be transitioning to a parachain in the future.
* `is_valid_para(ParaId) -> bool`: Returns true if the para ID references either a live parathread
  or live parachain.
* `can_upgrade_validation_code(ParaId) -> bool`: Returns true if the given para can signal code upgrade right now.
* `pvfs_require_prechecking() -> Vec<ValidationCodeHash>`: Returns the list of PVF validation code hashes that require PVF pre-checking votes.

## Finalization

Collect all `(para_id, next_possible_upgrade_at)` from `UpgradeCooldowns` where `next_possible_upgrade_at <= now` and prune them. For each para pruned remove its `UpgradeRestrictionSignal`.
