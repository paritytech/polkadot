# Overseer Protocol

This chapter contains message types sent to and from the overseer, and the underlying subsystem message types that are transmitted using these.

## Overseer Signal

Signals from the overseer to a subsystem to request change in execution that has to be obeyed by the subsystem.

```rust
enum OverseerSignal {
  /// Signal about a change in active leaves.
  ActiveLeavesUpdate(ActiveLeavesUpdate),
  /// Signal about a new best finalized block.
  BlockFinalized(Hash),
  /// Conclude all operation.
  Conclude,
}
```

All subsystems have their own message types; all of them need to be able to listen for overseer signals as well. There are currently two proposals for how to handle that with unified communication channels:

1. Retaining the `OverseerSignal` definition above, add `enum FromOverseer<T> {Signal(OverseerSignal), Message(T)}`.
1. Add a generic varint to `OverseerSignal`: `Message(T)`.

Either way, there will be some top-level type encapsulating messages from the overseer to each subsystem.

## Active Leaves Update

Indicates a change in active leaves. Activated leaves should have jobs, whereas deactivated leaves should lead to winding-down of work based on those leaves.

```rust
enum LeafStatus {
    // A leaf is fresh when it's the first time the leaf has been encountered.
    // Most leaves should be fresh.
    Fresh,
    // A leaf is stale when it's encountered for a subsequent time. This will
    // happen when the chain is reverted or the fork-choice rule abandons some
    // chain.
    Stale,
}

struct ActiveLeavesUpdate {
    activated: [(Hash, Number, LeafStatus)], // in practice, these should probably be a SmallVec
    deactivated: [Hash],
}
```

## All Messages

A message type tying together all message types that are used across Subsystems.

```rust
enum AllMessages {
    CandidateValidation(CandidateValidationMessage),
    CandidateBacking(CandidateBackingMessage),
    ChainApi(ChainApiMessage),

## Dispute Coordinator Message

Messages received by the [Dispute Coordinator subsystem](../node/disputes/dispute-coordinator.md)

This subsystem coordinates participation in disputes, tracks live disputes, and observed statements of validators from subsystems.

    /// Import a statement by a validator about a candidate.
    ///
    /// The subsystem will silently discard ancient statements or sets of only dispute-specific statements for
    /// candidates that are previously unknown to the subsystem. The former is simply because ancient

    /// statements already undergo anti-DoS procedures in their respective subsystems, but statements
    /// cast specifically for disputes are not necessarily relevant to any candidate the system is
    /// already aware of and thus present a DoS vector. Our expectation is that nodes will notify each
    /// other of disputes over the network by providing (at least) 2 conflicting statements, of which one is either
    /// a backing or validation statement.

        statements: Vec<(DisputeStatement, ValidatorIndex, ValidatorSignature)>,

        /// Inform the requester once we finished importing.
        ///
        /// This is, we either discarded the votes, just record them because we

## Runtime API Message

The Runtime API subsystem is responsible for providing an interface to the state of the chain's runtime.

This is fueled by an auxiliary type encapsulating all request types defined in the Runtime API section of the guide.

> To do: link to the Runtime API section. Not possible currently because of https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/mdbook-linkcheck/issues/25. Once v0.7.1 is released it will work.

```rust
enum RuntimeApiRequest {
    /// Get the version of the runtime API at the given parent hash, if any.
    Version(ResponseChannel<u32>),
    /// Get the current validator set.
    Validators(ResponseChannel<Vec<ValidatorId>>),
    /// Get the validator groups and rotation info.
    ValidatorGroups(ResponseChannel<(Vec<Vec<ValidatorIndex>>, GroupRotationInfo)>),
    /// Get information about all availability cores.
    AvailabilityCores(ResponseChannel<Vec<CoreState>>),
    /// with the given occupied core assumption.
    PersistedValidationData(
        ParaId,
        OccupiedCoreAssumption,
        ResponseChannel<Option<PersistedValidationData>>,
    ),
    /// Sends back `true` if the commitments pass all acceptance criteria checks.
    CheckValidationOutputs(
        ParaId,
        CandidateCommitments,
        RuntimeApiSender<bool>,
    ),
    /// Get the session index for children of the block. This can be used to construct a signing
    /// context.
    SessionIndexForChild(ResponseChannel<SessionIndex>),
    /// Get the validation code for a specific para, using the given occupied core assumption.
    ValidationCode(ParaId, OccupiedCoreAssumption, ResponseChannel<Option<ValidationCode>>),
    /// Get validation code by its hash, either past, current or future code can be returned,
    /// as long as state is still available.
    ValidationCodeByHash(ValidationCodeHash, RuntimeApiSender<Option<ValidationCode>>),
    /// Get a committed candidate receipt for all candidates pending availability.
    CandidatePendingAvailability(ParaId, ResponseChannel<Option<CommittedCandidateReceipt>>),
    /// Get all events concerning candidates in the last block.
    CandidateEvents(ResponseChannel<Vec<CandidateEvent>>),
    /// Get the session info for the given session, if stored.
    SessionInfo(SessionIndex, ResponseChannel<Option<SessionInfo>>),
    /// Get all the pending inbound messages in the downward message queue for a para.
    DmqContents(ParaId, ResponseChannel<Vec<InboundDownwardMessage<BlockNumber>>>),
    /// Get the contents of all channels addressed to the given recipient. Channels that have no
    /// messages in them are also included.
    InboundHrmpChannelsContents(ParaId, ResponseChannel<BTreeMap<ParaId, Vec<InboundHrmpMessage<BlockNumber>>>>),
    /// Get information about the BABE epoch this block was produced in.
    BabeEpoch(ResponseChannel<BabeEpoch>),
}

enum RuntimeApiMessage {
    /// Make a request of the runtime API against the post-state of the given relay-parent.
    Request(Hash, RuntimeApiRequest),
    /// Get the version of the runtime API at the given parent hash, if any.
    Version(Hash, ResponseChannel<Option<u32>>)
}
```

## Statement Distribution Message

The Statement Distribution subsystem distributes signed statements and candidates from validators to other validators. It does this by distributing full statements, which embed the candidate receipt, as opposed to compact statements which don't.
It receives updates from the network bridge and signed statements to share with other validators.

This is a network protocol that receives messages of type [`StatementDistributionV1Message`][StatementDistributionV1NetworkMessage].

```rust
enum StatementDistributionMessage {
    /// An update from the network bridge.
    NetworkBridgeUpdate(NetworkBridgeEvent<StatementDistributionV1Message>),
    /// We have validated a candidate and want to share our judgment with our peers.
    /// The hash is the relay parent.
    ///
    /// The statement distribution subsystem assumes that the statement should be correctly
    /// signed.
    Share(Hash, SignedFullStatement),
}
```

## Validation Request Type

Various modules request that the [Candidate Validation subsystem](../node/utility/candidate-validation.md) validate a block with this message. It returns [`ValidationOutputs`](candidate.md#validationoutputs) for successful validation.

```rust

/// The outcome of the candidate-validation's PVF pre-check request.
pub enum PreCheckOutcome {
    /// The PVF has been compiled successfully within the given constraints.
    Valid,
    /// The PVF could not be compiled. This variant is used when the candidate-validation subsystem
    /// can be sure that the PVF is invalid. To give a couple of examples: a PVF that cannot be
    /// decompressed or that does not represent a structurally valid WebAssembly file.
    Invalid,
    /// This variant is used when the PVF cannot be compiled but for other reasons that are not
    /// included into [`PreCheckOutcome::Invalid`]. This variant can indicate that the PVF in
    /// question is invalid, however it is not necessary that PVF that received this judgement
    /// is invalid.
    ///
    /// For example, if during compilation the preparation worker was killed we cannot be sure why
    /// it happened: because the PVF was malicious made the worker to use too much memory or its
    /// because the host machine is under severe memory pressure and it decided to kill the worker.
    Failed,
}

/// Result of the validation of the candidate.
enum ValidationResult {
    /// Candidate is valid, and here are the outputs and the validation data used to form inputs.
    /// In practice, this should be a shared type so that validation caching can be done.
    Valid(CandidateCommitments, PersistedValidationData),
    /// Candidate is invalid.
    Invalid,
}

const BACKING_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT: Duration = 2 seconds;
const APPROVAL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT: Duration = 6 seconds;

/// Messages received by the Validation subsystem.
///
/// ## Validation Requests
///
/// Validation requests made to the subsystem should return an error only on internal error.
/// Otherwise, they should return either `Ok(ValidationResult::Valid(_))`
/// or `Ok(ValidationResult::Invalid)`.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum CandidateValidationMessage {
    /// Validate a candidate with provided parameters using relay-chain state.
    ///
    /// This will implicitly attempt to gather the `PersistedValidationData` and `ValidationCode`
    /// from the runtime API of the chain, based on the `relay_parent`
    /// of the `CandidateDescriptor`.
    ///
    /// This will also perform checking of validation outputs against the acceptance criteria.
    ///
    /// If there is no state available which can provide this data or the core for
    /// the para is not free at the relay-parent, an error is returned.
    ValidateFromChainState(
        CandidateDescriptor,

    /// validation without needing to access the state of the relay-chain.
    ///
    /// This request doesn't involve acceptance criteria checking, therefore only useful for the
    /// cases where the validity of the candidate is established. This is the case for the typical
    /// use-case: secondary checkers would use this request relying on the full prior checks
    /// performed by the relay-chain.
    ValidateFromExhaustive(
        PersistedValidationData,
        ValidationCode,
