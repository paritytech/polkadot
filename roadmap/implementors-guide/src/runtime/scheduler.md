# Scheduler Module

> TODO: this section is still heavily under construction. key questions about availability cores and validator assignment are still open and the flow of the the section may be contradictory or inconsistent

The Scheduler module is responsible for two main tasks:

- Partitioning validators into groups and assigning groups to parachains and parathreads.
- Scheduling parachains and parathreads

It aims to achieve these tasks with these goals in mind:

- It should be possible to know at least a block ahead-of-time, ideally more, which validators are going to be assigned to which parachains.
- Parachains that have a candidate pending availability in this fork of the chain should not be assigned.
- Validator assignments should not be gameable. Malicious cartels should not be able to manipulate the scheduler to assign themselves as desired.
- High or close to optimal throughput of parachains and parathreads. Work among validator groups should be balanced.

The Scheduler manages resource allocation using the concept of "Availability Cores". There will be one availability core for each parachain, and a fixed number of cores used for multiplexing parathreads. Validators will be partitioned into groups, with the same number of groups as availability cores. Validator groups will be assigned to different availability cores over time.

An availability core can exist in either one of two states at the beginning or end of a block: free or occupied. A free availability core can have a parachain or parathread assigned to it for the potential to have a backed candidate included. After inclusion, the core enters the occupied state as the backed candidate is pending availability. There is an important distinction: a core is not considered occupied until it is in charge of a block pending availability, although the implementation may treat scheduled cores the same as occupied ones for brevity. A core exits the occupied state when the candidate is no longer pending availability - either on timeout or on availability. A core starting in the occupied state can move to the free state and back to occupied all within a single block, as availability bitfields are processed before backed candidates. At the end of the block, there is a possible timeout on availability which can move the core back to the free state if occupied.

Validator group assignments do not need to change very quickly. The security benefits of fast rotation is redundant with the challenge mechanism in the [Validity module](/runtime/validity.html). Because of this, we only divide validators into groups at the beginning of the session and do not shuffle membership during the session. However, we do take steps to ensure that no particular validator group has dominance over a single parachain or parathread-multiplexer for an entire session to provide better guarantees of liveness.

Validator groups rotate across availability cores in a round-robin fashion, with rotation occurring at fixed intervals. The i'th group will be assigned to the `(i+k)%n`'th core at any point in time, where `k` is the number of rotations that have occurred in the session, and `n` is the number of cores. This makes upcoming rotations within the same session predictable.

When a rotation occurs, validator groups are still responsible for distributing availability chunks for any previous cores that are still occupied and pending availability. In practice, rotation and availability-timeout frequencies should be set so this will only be the core they have just been rotated from. It is possible that a validator group is rotated onto a core which is currently occupied. In this case, the validator group will have nothing to do until the previously-assigned group finishes their availability work and frees the core or the availability process times out. Depending on if the core is for a parachain or parathread, a different timeout `t` from the [`HostConfiguration`](/type-definitions.html#host-configuration) will apply. Availability timeouts should only be triggered in the first `t-1` blocks after the beginning of a rotation.

Parathreads operate on a system of claims. Collators participate in auctions to stake a claim on authoring the next block of a parathread, although the auction mechanism is beyond the scope of the scheduler. The scheduler guarantees that they'll be given at least a certain number of attempts to author a candidate that is backed. Attempts that fail during the availability phase are not counted, since ensuring availability at that stage is the responsibility of the backing validators, not of the collator. When a claim is accepted, it is placed into a queue of claims, and each claim is assigned to a particular parathread-multiplexing core in advance. Given that the current assignments of validator groups to cores are known, and the upcoming assignments are predictable, it is possible for parathread collators to know who they should be talking to now and how they should begin establishing connections with as a fallback.

With this information, the Node-side can be aware of which parathreads have a good chance of being includable within the relay-chain block and can focus any additional resources on backing candidates from those parathreads. Furthermore, Node-side code is aware of which validator group will be responsible for that thread. If the necessary conditions are reached for core reassignment, those candidates can be backed within the same block as the core being freed.

Parathread claims, when scheduled onto a free core, may not result in a block pending availability. This may be due to collator error, networking timeout, or censorship by the validator group. In this case, the claims should be retried a certain number of times to give the collator a fair shot.

Cores are treated as an ordered list of cores and are typically referred to by their index in that list.

## Storage

Utility structs:

```rust
// A claim on authoring the next block for a given parathread.
struct ParathreadClaim(ParaId, CollatorId);

// An entry tracking a claim to ensure it does not pass the maximum number of retries.
struct ParathreadEntry {
  claim: ParathreadClaim,
  retries: u32,
}

// A queued parathread entry, pre-assigned to a core.
struct QueuedParathread {
 claim: ParathreadEntry,
 core: CoreIndex,
}

struct ParathreadQueue {
 queue: Vec<QueuedParathread>,
 // this value is between 0 and config.parathread_cores
 next_core: CoreIndex,
}

enum CoreOccupied {
  Parathread(ParathreadEntry), // claim & retries
  Parachain,
}

struct CoreAssignment {
  core: CoreIndex,
  para_id: ParaId,
  collator: Option<CollatorId>,
  group_idx: GroupIndex,
}
```

Storage layout:

```rust
/// All the validator groups. One for each core.
ValidatorGroups: Vec<Vec<ValidatorIndex>>;
/// A queue of upcoming claims and which core they should be mapped onto.
ParathreadQueue: ParathreadQueue;
/// One entry for each availability core. Entries are `None` if the core is not currently occupied. Can be
/// temporarily `Some` if scheduled but not occupied.
/// The i'th parachain belongs to the i'th core, with the remaining cores all being
/// parathread-multiplexers.
AvailabilityCores: Vec<Option<CoreOccupied>>;
/// An index used to ensure that only one claim on a parathread exists in the queue or is
/// currently being handled by an occupied core.
ParathreadClaimIndex: Vec<ParaId>;
/// The block number where the session start occurred. Used to track how many group rotations have occurred.
SessionStartBlock: BlockNumber;
/// Currently scheduled cores - free but up to be occupied. Ephemeral storage item that's wiped on finalization.
Scheduled: Vec<CoreAssignment>, // sorted ascending by CoreIndex.
```

## Session Change

Session changes are the only time that configuration can change, and the [Configuration module](/runtime/configuration.html)'s session-change logic is handled before this module's. We also lean on the behavior of the [Inclusion module](/runtime/inclusion.html) which clears all its occupied cores on session change. Thus we don't have to worry about cores being occupied across session boundaries and it is safe to re-size the `AvailabilityCores` bitfield.

Actions:

1. Set `SessionStartBlock` to current block number.
1. Clear all `Some` members of `AvailabilityCores`. Return all parathread claims to queue with retries un-incremented.
1. Set `configuration = Configuration::configuration()` (see [`HostConfiguration`](/type-definitions.html#host-configuration))
1. Resize `AvailabilityCores` to have length `Paras::parachains().len() + configuration.parathread_cores with all`None` entries.
1. Compute new validator groups by shuffling using a secure randomness beacon
   - We need a total of `N = Paras::parathreads().len() + configuration.parathread_cores` validator groups.
   - The total number of validators `V` in the `SessionChangeNotification`'s `validators` may not be evenly divided by `V`.
   - First, we obtain "shuffled validators" `SV` by shuffling the validators using the `SessionChangeNotification`'s random seed.
   - The groups are selected by partitioning `SV`. The first V % N groups will have (V / N) + 1 members, while the remaining groups will have (V / N) members each.
1. Prune the parathread queue to remove all retries beyond `configuration.parathread_retries`.
   - all pruned claims should have their entry removed from the parathread index.
   - assign all non-pruned claims to new cores if the number of parathread cores has changed between the `new_config` and `old_config` of the `SessionChangeNotification`.
   - Assign claims in equal balance across all cores if rebalancing, and set the `next_core` of the `ParathreadQueue` by incrementing the relative index of the last assigned core and taking it modulo the number of parathread cores.

## Initialization

1. Schedule free cores using the `schedule(Vec::new())`.

## Finalization

Actions:

1. Free all scheduled cores and return parathread claims to queue, with retries incremented.

## Routines

- `add_parathread_claim(ParathreadClaim)`: Add a parathread claim to the queue.
  - Fails if any parathread claim on the same parathread is currently indexed.
  - Fails if the queue length is >= `config.scheduling_lookahead * config.parathread_cores`.
  - The core used for the parathread claim is the `next_core` field of the `ParathreadQueue` and adding `Paras::parachains().len()` to it.
  - `next_core` is then updated by adding 1 and taking it modulo `config.parathread_cores`.
  - The claim is then added to the claim index.
- `schedule(Vec<CoreIndex>)`: schedule new core assignments, with a parameter indicating previously-occupied cores which are to be considered returned.
  - All freed parachain cores should be assigned to their respective parachain
  - All freed parathread cores should have the claim removed from the claim index.
  - All freed parathread cores should take the next parathread entry from the queue.
  - The i'th validator group will be assigned to the `(i+k)%n`'th core at any point in time, where `k` is the number of rotations that have occurred in the session, and `n` is the total number of cores. This makes upcoming rotations within the same session predictable.
- `scheduled() -> Vec<CoreAssignment>`: Get currently scheduled core assignments.
- `occupied(Vec<CoreIndex>)`. Note that the given cores have become occupied.
  - Fails if any given cores were not scheduled.
  - Fails if the given cores are not sorted ascending by core index
  - This clears them from `Scheduled` and marks each corresponding `core` in the `AvailabilityCores` as occupied.
  - Since both the availability cores and the newly-occupied cores lists are sorted ascending, this method can be implemented efficiently.
- `core_para(CoreIndex) -> ParaId`: return the currently-scheduled or occupied ParaId for the given core.
- `group_validators(GroupIndex) -> Option<Vec<ValidatorIndex>>`: return all validators in a given group, if the group index is valid for this session.
- `availability_timeout_predicate() -> Option<impl Fn(CoreIndex, BlockNumber) -> bool>`: returns an optional predicate that should be used for timing out occupied cores. if `None`, no timing-out should be done. The predicate accepts the index of the core, and the block number since which it has been occupied. The predicate should be implemented based on the time since the last validator group rotation, and the respective parachain and parathread timeouts, i.e. only within `max(config.chain_availability_period, config.thread_availability_period)` of the last rotation would this return `Some`.
