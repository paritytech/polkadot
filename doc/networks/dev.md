### Dev network

You can run a simple single-node development "network" on your machine by running in a terminal:

```bash
polkadot --dev
```

You can muck around by cloning and building the http://github.com/paritytech/polka-ui and http://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-ui or just heading to https://polkadot.js.org/apps.
