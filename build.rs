//! - [x] `cargo run`, commit, `cargo run` again (workers should be rebuilt the second time)

//! - [x] `cargo clean` then `cargo build` (workers should be built)
//!
//! - [x] `cargo +<specific-toolchain> run` (same as `cargo run`)
//!
//! - [ ] TODO: `cargo clean` then `cargo install` (latest workers should be installed)
//!
//! - [ ] TODO: `cargo clean`, `cargo run`, then `cargo install` with binaries already having been
//!       built.
//!
//! - [x] `cargo run` with a profile, like `--profile testnet` (same as `cargo run`)
