/// sandboxes as new security layers in addition to the existing system-wide access-controls. This
/// kind of sandbox is expected to help mitigate the security impact of bugs, unexpected or
/// malicious behaviors in applications. Landlock empowers any process, including unprivileged ones,
/// to securely restrict themselves."

	/// Landlock ABI version. We use ABI V1 because:
	///
	/// 1. It is supported by our reference kernel version.
	/// 2. Later versions do not (yet) provide additional security.
	///
	/// # Versions (as of June 2023)
	///
	/// - Polkadot reference kernel version: 5.16+
	/// - ABI V1: 5.13 - introduces	landlock, including full restrictions on file reads
	/// - ABI V2: 5.19 - adds ability to configure file renaming (not used by us)
	///
	/// # Determinism
	///
	/// You may wonder whether we could always use the latest ABI instead of only the ABI supported
	/// by the reference kernel version. It seems plausible, since landlock provides a best-effort
	/// approach to enabling sandboxing. For example, if the reference version only supported V1 and
	/// we were on V2, then landlock would use V2 if it was supported on the current machine, and
	/// just fall back to V1 if not.
	///
	/// The issue with this is indeterminacy. If half of validators were on V2 and half were on V1,
	/// they may have different semantics on some PVFs. So a malicious PVF now has a new attack
	/// vector: they can exploit this indeterminism between landlock ABIs!
	///
	/// On the other hand we do want validators to be as secure as possible and protect their keys
	/// from attackers. And, the risk with indeterminacy is low and there are other indeterminacy
	/// vectors anyway. So we will only upgrade to a new ABI if either the reference kernel version
	/// supports it or if it introduces some new feature that is beneficial to security.
