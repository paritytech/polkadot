	/// categories, which we cannot distinguish programmatically:
	///
	/// (a) Some sort of transient glitch caused the worker process to abort. An example would be that
	///     the host machine ran out of free memory and the OOM killer started killing the processes,
	///     and in order to save the parent it will "sacrifice child" first.
	///
	/// (b) The candidate triggered a code path that has lead to the process death. For example,
	///     the PVF found a way to consume unbounded amount of resources and then it either exceeded
	///     an `rlimit` (if set) or, again, invited OOM killer. Another possibility is a bug in
	///     wasmtime allowed the PVF to gain control over the execution worker.
	///
	/// We attribute such an event to an *invalid candidate* in either case.
	///
	/// The rationale for this is that a glitch may lead to unfair rejecting candidate by a single
	/// validator. If the glitch is somewhat more persistent the validator will reject all candidate
	/// thrown at it and hopefully the operator notices it by decreased reward performance of the
	/// validator. On the other hand, if the worker died because of (b) we would have better chances
	/// to stop the attack.
	AmbiguousWorkerDeath,
	/// PVF execution (compilation is not included) took more time than was allotted.
	HardTimeout,
	/// A panic occurred and we can't be sure whether the candidate is really invalid or some internal glitch occurred.
	/// Whenever we are unsure, we can never treat an error as internal as we would abstain from voting. This is bad
	/// because if the issue was due to the candidate, then all validators would abstain, stalling finality on the
	/// chain. So we will first retry the candidate, and if the issue persists we are forced to vote invalid.
