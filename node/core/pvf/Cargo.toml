# PVF execution leverages compiled artifacts provided by wasmtime. The contents of the artifacts
# depends on the version of wasmtime. In this crate we persist the artifacts on disk so we should
# be careful about the updates. In order to handle this, we depend on the wasmtime version here
# that we think is used by the sc-executor. If wasmtime is updated in Substrate and wasn't updated
# here then there will be linking errors like
#
#     `multiple definitions of `set_vmctx_memory`.
#
# or similar, because wasmtime exports these symbols and does not support multiple versions compiled
# in at the same time.
#
# Another safeguard is a test `ensure_wasmtime_version` that will fail on each bump and prompt the
# developer to correspondingly act upon the change.
