//! Implements the dispute coordinator subsystem.
//!
//! This is the central subsystem of the node-side components which participate in disputes.
//! This subsystem wraps a database which tracks all statements observed by all validators over some window of sessions.
//! Votes older than this session window are pruned.
//!
//! This subsystem will be the point which produce dispute votes, either positive or negative, based on locally-observed
//! validation results as well as a sink for votes received by other subsystems. When importing a dispute vote from
//! another node, this will trigger the dispute participation subsystem to recover and validate the block and call
//! back to this subsystem.
